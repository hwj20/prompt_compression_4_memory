This is an initial version of method of pruning through different compression level. 

By learning through this project with reviews and sample paper(done by GPT), I know what prompt compression does and guess how far I can reach in this task.

The code of the KG one is on a local branch of this project, and it will be released once the paper is accepted or I decide to leave this project.

(If you were someone who comes across this project from CS281A@UCSB, you may know that there is a new project. If you like, just contact me, and I will email you a local copy of it.)
