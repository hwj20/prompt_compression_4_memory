This is an initial version of method of pruning through different compression level. 

By learning through this project with reviews and sample paper, I know what prompt compression does and how much I can reach in this task.

The code of the knowledge graph one is on a local branch of this project, and it will be released once the paper is accepted or I decide to leave this project.

But if you just want to know the code, just contact me, and I will email you a local copy of it.
